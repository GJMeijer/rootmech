\title{Calculate power-law logistic loglikelihood}
\usage{
powerlaw_logistic_loglikelihood(
  par,
  x,
  y,
  weights = rep(1, length(x)),
  deriv = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{vector with fitting parameters (power-law multiplier, power-law
exponent, and logistic shape parameter)}

\item{x}{measured x-values (e.g. root diameters). These values are assumed
to be already normalised by a reference value to ensure a dimensionless
parameter.}

\item{y}{measured y-values (e.g. root tensile strength)}

\item{weights}{vector with weighting for each observation (default: 1)}

\item{deriv}{order of partial derivative requested}
}
\value{
loglikelihood, or its partial derivatives to order `deriv`
}
\description{
Calculate the weighted loglikelihood for a power-law fit with logistic
residuals. Can also be used to calculate the first or second partial
derivative with respect to fitting parameters.
